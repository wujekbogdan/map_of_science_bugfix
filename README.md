# Map of Science

Discover the landscape of human knowledge through an interactive map. 

Navigate continents of scientific fields, dive into countries of subfields, and discover cities - whose size reflects the volume of research on each topic. The proximity of areas on the map mirrors how closely related the fields are.

## Editing

### Map

The map used in this project is located in `asset/foreground.svg`. It contains all the graphical elements used in the application. However, the file is being processed by the application to display only the relevant parts.

Example map SVG with valid settings, can be found in `templates/foreground_template.svg`.

### Layers

- The SVG file contains multiple layers, each associated with objects.
- The application sorts the layers lexicographically, displaying them in order from the most general to the most specific, depending on zoom level.
- Only the lexicographical order of layers matters; their names are irrelevant.
Hidden layers in Inkscape are ignored by the application.
- You can manage layers using Inkscape's *Layers and Objects* tool.

### Labels

- Objects within the SVG file can have labels.
- To add a label, assign the `inkscape:label` attribute or `id` to the object.
- Labels recognized by the application must start with `#` (e.g., `#Photonics`, `#Zażółć gęślą jaźń`).
- Labeling can be managed using Inkscape's "Layers and Objects" tool.

### Articles

The application uses HTML files to dynamically load article content. They are located in the `articles` directory. Each article is a separate file, named after the **label** of the object it describes. 

Labels are converted to filenames by skipping the first `#` character, replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores. For example:
- `#Material Science` -> `material_science.html` 
- `#Zażółć Jaźń` -> `za_____ja__.html`

The article files can contain any HTML content, including images, links, and other media. They will be displayed in a modal window when the user clicks on the object with the corresponding label.

Example article file can be found in `templates/article_template.html`.

## Data points
This application draws inspiration from the data set behind (yet another) *Map of Science* project, maintained by the [Emerging Technology Obervatory (ETO)](https://sciencemap.eto.tech/?mode=map). It includes hundreds of millions of scholarly publications from around the world, algorithmically organized into over 85,000 research clusters.
